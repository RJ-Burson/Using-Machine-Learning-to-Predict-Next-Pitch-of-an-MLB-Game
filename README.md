This repository contains all of the data and code that I used for my masters thesis "Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict the Next Pitch of an MLB Game." This includes all of the code used to scrape Baseball Savant for the pitch-by-pitch data for the entire 2021 and 2022 seasons and all player id datasets. Players stats (OPS, stolen base, and catcher stats) from prior seasons to determine players abilities for within the model. As well as code to balance the data for each individual pitcher that was able to be predicted by the model.
